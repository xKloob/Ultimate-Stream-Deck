"# Ultimate-Stream-Deck" 
Hello! Welcome to my first git repository. I'm not 100% sure abut what I am doing but I will try my best. This is for a project idea I had based on MisterR on thingiverse's MisterRdeck Stream controller (Link https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4627779/files). They have a really nice design and I LOVE IT!! I made 2 of them! One for me and one for my cousin. We both LOVE them. But anyway. I had an idea for a more open source and more customizable version. MisterR's design is amazing. But its not easy to customize. In the projects tab I created a list of stuff I would like to add and create simple support for to make creating these controllers easy for beginners! Elgatos products are nice but seem limited to me. I like the idea of customizing how to control my PC and I'm sure there are other people out there like me.
